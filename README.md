Project: Weather App (API Integration)

🛠 Focus:
The main goal of this project is to practice API integration by fetching real-time weather data and displaying it in a user-friendly interface.

✨ Features:
Users can search for a city by name.
Displays the current temperature in Celsius.
Shows basic weather conditions, including the general description (e.g., "Clouds") and more detailed info (e.g., "scattered clouds").
(Optional enhancement: Show a weather icon based on the condition using OpenWeatherMap icons.)
Automatically fetches and displays weather for a default city on app load using useEffect.

🧠 Concepts Practiced:
Conditional rendering to display weather data only after a successful API response.
Fetch API to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
React state (useState) to store the search input and API result.
React useEffect hook to auto-fetch default location weather on component mount.
